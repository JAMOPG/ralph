Key concepts \u00b6 Ralph has been designed to batch process your logs using base commands and UNIX standard streams ( stdin , stdout ) to connect them in a pipeline that fits your needs. A base example pipeline may be: $ ralph fetch --backend swift my_archive.gzip | \\ gunzip | \\ ralph push --backend es In this small pipeline, we stream my_archive.gzip content from a Swift container to the standard output (using the fetch command), uncompress the content (using the gunzip command), and bulk insert logs in an ElasticSearch index (using the push command). As UNIX is beautiful, Ralph offers many powerful possibilities by combining its commands with other standard commands or command line tools. Quick start guide \u00b6 Ralph is distributed as a python package and a Docker image. If you choose to install ralph in your native environment (without using Docker), please make sure that Python 3.9 is installed (and your default python distribution). Ralph package can be installed from PyPI using the pip tool: # Create a new virtualenv (optionnal) $ python3.9 -m venv venv $ source venv/bin/activate # Install the package (in a virtualenv) (venv) $ pip install ralph-malph # Test the ralph command (it should be in your PATH) (venv) $ ralph --help Alternatively, Docker users can pull the latest ralph image and start playing with it: # Pull latest docker image and get usage $ docker run --rm -i fundocker/ralph:latest ralph --help # Pro tip: define an alias to ease your life $ alias ralph=\"docker run --rm -i fundocker/ralph:latest ralph\" Now that ralph can be run from your system, we invite you to explore available commands . Contributing \u00b6 This project is intended to be community-driven, so please, do not hesitate to get in touch if you have any question related to our implementation or design decisions.

Implemented backends are listed below along with their configuration parameters. If your favourite backend is missing to the list, feel free to submit your implementation or get in touch! Key concepts \u00b6 We distinguish storage from database backends as the semantic and concepts are quite different in terms of code, but those two types of backends can be considered as \u201cbackends\u201d from a Ralph user perspective as the CLI can use both in most of its commands. Each backend has its own parameters that are required to use it. Those parameters can be set as command line options or environment variables; the later is the recommended solution for sensible data such as service credentials. If we consider the os_username (OpenStack user name) parameter of the OpenStack Swift backend, it can be set as a command line option using swift as the option prefix (and replacing underscores in its name by dashes): $ ralph list --backend swift --swift-os-username johndoe # [...] more options Alternatively, this parameter can be set as an environment variable (in upper case, prefixed by the program name, e.g. RALPH_ ): $ export RALPH_SWIFT_OS_USERNAME=\"johndoe\" $ ralph list --backend swift # [...] more options The general patterns for backend parameters are: --{{ backend_name }}-{{ parameter | underscore_to_dash }} for command options, and, RALPH_{{ backend_name | uppercase }}_{{ parameter | uppercase }} for environment variables. Storage backends \u00b6 OVH - Log Data Platform (LDP) \u00b6 LDP is a nice service build by OVH on top of Graylog to follow, analyse and store your logs. Learning events ( aka tracking logs) can be stored in GELF format using this backend. For now the LDP backend is read-only as we consider that it is mostly used to collect primary logs and not as a Ralph target. Feel free to get in touch to prove us wrong, or better: submit your proposal for the write method implementation. Backend parameters \u00b6 To access to OVH\u2019s LDP API, you need to register Ralph as an authorized application and generate an application key, an application secret and a consumer key. While filling the registration form available at: eu.api.ovh.com/createToken/ , be sure to give an appropriate validity time span to your token and allow only GET requests on the /dbaas/logs/* path. endpoint : the API endpoint ( e.g. ovh-eu ) application_key : use generated application key application_secret : use generated application secret consumer_key : use generated consumer key The following parameters are required to fetch archives from an LDP account stream: service_name : the LDP account name ( e.g. ldp-xx-xxxxx ) stream_id : the identifier of the stream you are querying ( e.g. a UUID hex representation: 77ec6e4a-ac15-4bcf-8043-7429bf275e49 ) For more information about OVH\u2019s API client parameters, please refer to the project\u2019s documentation: github.com/ovh/python-ovh . OpenStack Swift \u00b6 Swift is the OpenStack object storage service. This storage backend is fully supported (read and write operations) to stream and store log archives. Backend parameters \u00b6 Primarily required parameters correspond to a standard authentication using OpenStack Keystone service: os_identity_api_version : keystone API version you will authenticate to (defaults to 3 ) os_auth_url : the authentication URL (defaults to OVH\u2019s Swift https://auth.cloud.ovh.net/ ) os_project_domain_name : the project domain name (defaults to Default ) os_user_domain_name : the user domain name (defaults to Default ) os_username : the name of your openstack swift user os_password : the password of your openstack swift user Secondary parameters are required to work with the target container: os_storage_url : the URL of the target container os_region_name : the region where your container is os_tenant_name : the name of the tenant of your container os_tenant_id : the identifier of the tenant of your container File system \u00b6 The file system backend is a dummy template that can be used to develop your own backend. It\u2019s a \u201cdummy\u201d backend as it\u2019s not required in a UNIX Shell context, the ls and cat commands used along with UNIX streams will do a better job. Backend parameters \u00b6 The only required parameter is the path we want to list or stream content from. Database backends \u00b6 Elasticsearch \u00b6 Elasticsearch backend is mostly used for indexation purpose (as a datalake) but it can also be used to fetch indexed data from it. Backend parameters \u00b6 Elasticsearch backend parameters required to connect to a cluster are: hosts : a list of cluster hosts to connect to ( e.g. [\"http://elasticsearch-node:9200\"] ) index : the elasticsearch index where to get/put documents client_options : all options from the offical client are supported and can be specified as a python dict object ( e.g. {'use_ssl': True, 'verify_certs': True} ) For a complete list of supported client_options , please refer to the official client\u2019s documentation .","title":"Backends"},{"location":"backends/#backends","text":"Ralph supports various storage and database backends that can be accessed to read from or write learning events to.

But on the other side, Ralph is a tool dedicated to learning events processing so we\u2019ve implemented key features related to learning events validation and convertion. For now, we mostly focus on two learning events standards: Open edX and xAPI . Data validation and serialisation/de-serialisation is achieved using pydantics models that are documented in the following subsections: Open edX","title":"Rationale"},{"location":"models/edx/","text":"\u00b6 base \u00b6 Base event model definitions BaseContextModel pydantic-model \u00b6 Represents the base context model inherited by all event contexts.
